This directory and its subdirectories contains distribution/OS
specific configuration options.

If you are just installing a Grimoire package from your distribution-
or OS-vendor, you can safely ignore this directory in its entiety, as
your vendor should have taken care of it.

If you, on the other hand, is packaging Grimoire for a distribution or
OS, or are installing from tgz on your own, you will need to change
the configuration options in this directory tree to match your
distribution/OS.
