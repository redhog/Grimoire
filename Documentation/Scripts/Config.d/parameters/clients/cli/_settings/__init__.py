## Command-line client (CLI) ##

# Default command(s) to perform if no command is given on the
# command-line. Comment-out to give a command-prompt in that case. If
# not commented out, one can still get the command/prompt by giving an
# empty string as command, e.g. grimoire "_" ""
# set(['defaultcommands'], ['_.trees.server.dirt("_", 0)'])

# Tree configuration
# Any config that can go into
# Config.d/parameters/clients/_settings/__init__.py can go here.
