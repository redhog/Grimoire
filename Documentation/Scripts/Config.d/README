The configuration for various parts of Grimoire are spread out over
several sub-directories of this directory. If you would like to know
more about the structure and loading of these files, and why some
directories have a leading underscore in their names, please look
under "The Directory" in the overview  documentation.

In these files, commented-out commands do have usefull defaults and
need not be set in all situations. Usually, the first commented-out
example is also the default (if the default is not to have no value at
all). If a configuration value does need change for Grimoire to work
at all, it is not commented out.

If a configuration value need to be set, and is a password, an invalid
value that will be rejected (such as a non-string-value, e.g. None) is
set by the non-commented-out command, and another commented-out copy
of the command exists on the previous line, that sets the password to
"changethisdefaultpassword".

NEVER LEAVE A DEFAULT PASSWORD as that
would leave your system SUSCEPTIBLE TO BREAK-INS!
